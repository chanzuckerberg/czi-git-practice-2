I was skeptical of getting udon to-go, but Udon Mugizo packages everything so that it's as if you're eating at the restaurant, just at home! They give plenty of instructions to reheat the soup and prepare the noodles so that it's the optimal temperature to eat. I got the combo udon with a rice bowl and the udon was supposed to be smaller than the normal entree dish, but it was very filling! I ended up having the combo as two separate meals. Would highly recommend if you want some authentic Japanese udon!
